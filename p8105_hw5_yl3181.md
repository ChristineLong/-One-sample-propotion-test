#Combine name with corresponding contents into one file and tidy it
file = cbind(file_name,file_content) %>%
  separate(file_name, into = c("waste1", "arm", "waste2", "subject","waste3"), sep = c(7,10,11,13)) %>% 
  select(-starts_with("waste")) %>% 
  gather(key = "week", value = "observation", starts_with("week")) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(str_replace(week, "week_", "")))
```

``` r
#Make a spaghetti plot with two panels for better observe the difference
ggplot(file, aes(x = week, y = observation, color = subject)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(~arm)
```

![](p8105_hw5_yl3181_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

As we can see in the plot:

-   The baseline for control group and experiment group are similar;
-   The experiment group has a more rapid increase in observation values, while control group has little change in observation values
